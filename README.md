# UMGW
Code for Multi-marginal Gromov-Wasserstein computations as well as unbalanced and fused versions

The code (particularly the fused examples) contains some redundancies which will be removed soon.

Parts of the implementation relies on or is built ontop of existing implementations from the Python Optimal Transport package (POT) https://pythonot.github.io/ and T. Séjournés implementation for unbalanced Gromov-Wasserstein https://github.com/thibsej/unbalanced_gromov_wasserstein.
